### CS50 Scratch Project â€“ Summary

Create any Scratch project of your choice â€” a story, game, animation, or other â€” following these **core requirements**:

#### âœ… Minimum Requirements
- **At least 2 sprites**, one of which **must not** be a cat.
- **At least 3 scripts total** (not necessarily per sprite).
- **Use at least:**
  - 1 conditional (`if`, `if-else`)
  - 1 loop (`repeat`, `forever`, etc.)
  - 1 variable
  - 1 **custom block** created via "Make a Block", with at least one **input**

#### ðŸŽ¯ Design Expectations
- Project should be more complex than basic examples shown in lecture.
- It may be simpler than projects like *Oscartime* or *Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game*.
- Should involve **a few dozen blocks** overall.
- Code should demonstrate:
  - Clean structure and readability
  - Logical separation of functionality
  - Use of **abstraction** via well-named custom blocks

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips & Best Practices
- Donâ€™t build everything at once. Work in **small steps**:
  1. Build a small part
  2. Test it
  3. Repeat
- Save often: `File > Save now`
- Explore [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu) for examples or inspiration, but focus on building your own idea.
- If somethingâ€™s too hard, simplify your design or work around it.

#### ðŸ“¦ Submission
- After finishing, go to `File > Save now`
- Then `File > Save to your computer` and keep the file for submission
